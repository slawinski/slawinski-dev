One suggestion though. Personally I had troubles configuring the Sendgrid as a first time user. Could you put more emphasis on the fact that besides API key a user also has to do "Sender Authentication" and if she/he chooses "Single Sender Verification" then the `from` and `to` emails from your snippet have to be the same.
