*Important disclaimer:*
- The list is not definitive and will change.


## Getting down to business
If you don't know anything about programming and/or web development I recommend you to take a look at any of the three resources listed below. They we're designed with beginners in mind and will set you up for the upcoming journey of becoming a developer. I really recommend to check out the rest of this list too - it's full of great stuff!

üî• [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
üî• [Colt's Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblA84xge2_xNtaFnZhefjFbnDrpySKD3)
üî• [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) üî•

## Blogs
There are a lot of creators out there and some of them particularily focus on beginners. I regret this list is so short but you can help by expanding it!

## Blogposts
Every now and then I stumble upon a post which resonates with my inner programmer. I hope you also will find them interesting.

## Books
The problem with books is while they get written, edited, printed, and optionally translated, the javascript world moves forward and they quickly stop being relevant. But if books work for you and you enjoy smelling that freshly downloaded pdf then here's a short list of books you might find useful.

|link|description|
|---|---|
|[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)|Probably the first book a beginner should read|
|[You Don't Know JS Yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed)|Definetely the second book (series) a beginner should read because it gets very technical very quickly|
|[The Ultimate Guide To Getting Started As A Software Engineer](https://randallkanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Getting-Started-As-A-Software-Engineer.pdf)|"This guide will help you get started coding with low risk to your financial future and time."|

## Online courses
I like to have a plan of what should I learn. A step-by-step guide. Someone who will say "Welcome back!" when I log in. Online courses have it all (the 'welcome back' part depends on the good will of the presenter though).

Some aspects of programming can be taught by games which makes learning fun and, hopefuly, quicker.
