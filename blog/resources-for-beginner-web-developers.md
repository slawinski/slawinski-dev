*Important disclaimer:*
- The list is not definitive. You can help by expanding it!


## Getting down to business
If you don't know anything about programming and/or web development I recommend you take a look at any of the three resources listed below. They were created with beginners in mind and will set you up for the upcoming journey of becoming a developer. I really recommend to check out the rest of this list too - it's full of great stuff!

üî• [Colt's Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblA84xge2_xNtaFnZhefjFbnDrpySKD3)
üî• [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
üî• [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) üî•

## Blogs
There are a lot of creators out there and some of them particularly focus on beginners. I regret this list is so short!

|link|description|
|---|---|
|[BaseCS](https://medium.com/basecs)|"Exploring the basics of computer science, every Monday, for a year."|
|[https://dev.to/top/infinity](https://dev.to/top/infinity)|Just read some of the most popular blog posts listed here and you're golden!|

## Blog posts
Every now and then I stumble upon a post which resonates with my inner programmer. I hope you also will find them interesting.

|link|description|
|---|---|
|[Am I a real software engineer yet](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/am-i-a-real-software-engineer-yet-a0f38a2248c0/)|Interesting take on what people think about web developers and why should you care|

## Books
The problem with books is while they get written, edited, printed, and optionally translated, the javascript world moves forward and they quickly stop being relevant. But if books work for you and you enjoy the smell of that freshly downloaded pdf then here's a shortlist of books you might find useful.

|link|description|
|---|---|
|[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)|Probably the first book a beginner should read|
|[You Don't Know JS Yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed)|Definetely the second book (series) a beginner should read because it gets very technical very quickly|
|[The Ultimate Guide To Getting Started As A Software Engineer](https://randallkanna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Getting-Started-As-A-Software-Engineer.pdf)|"This guide will help you get started coding with low risk to your financial future and time."|

## Online courses
I like to have a plan for what should I learn. A step-by-step guide. Someone who will say *Welcome back!* when I log in. Online courses have it all (the 'welcome back' part depends on the goodwill of the presenter though).

|link|description|
